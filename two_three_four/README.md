# 2-3-4 PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

## ASSIGNMENT DIRECTIONS

Using the 2-3-4 tree we wrote, implement a method called `inorderTraversal` that performs an inorder traversal of the tree, and a `delete` method that flags a node in the tree as deleted.

Criterion:

☑ `inorderTraversal` properly displays the nodes of the tree in order.

☑ `delete` properly flags a node as deleted
